﻿Microsoft Patent Promise for .NET Libraries and Runtime Components 

Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates ("Microsoft") promise not to assert 
any .NET Patents against you for making, using, selling, offering for sale, 
importing, or distributing Covered Code, as part of either a .NET Runtime or 
as part of any application designed to run on a .NET Runtime. 

If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in any claim in a lawsuit 
alleging direct or contributory patent infringement by any Covered Code, or 
inducement of patent infringement by any Covered Code, then your rights under 
this promise will automatically terminate. 

This promise is not an assurance that (i) any .NET Patents are valid or 
enforceable, or (ii) Covered Code does not infringe patents or other 
intellectual property rights of any third party. No rights except those 
expressly stated in this promise are granted, waived, or received by 
Microsoft, whether by implication, exhaustion, estoppel, or otherwise. 
This is a personal promise directly from Microsoft to you, and you agree as a 
condition of benefiting from it that no Microsoft rights are received from 
suppliers, distributors, or otherwise from any other person in connection with 
this promise. 

Definitions: 

"Covered Code" means those Microsoft .NET libraries and runtime components as 
made available by Microsoft at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime.

".NET Patents" are those patent claims, both currently owned by Microsoft and 
acquired in the future, that are necessarily infringed by Covered Code. .NET 
Patents do not include any patent claims that are infringed by any Enabling 
Technology, that are infringed only as a consequence of modification of 
Covered Code, or that are infringed only by the combination of Covered Code 
with third party code. 

".NET Runtime" means any compliant implementation in software of (a) all of 
the required parts of the mandatory provisions of Standard ECMA-335 – Common 
Language Infrastructure (CLI); and (b) if implemented, any additional 
functionality in Microsoft's .NET Framework, as described in Microsoft's API 
documentation on its MSDN website. For example, .NET Runtimes include 
Microsoft's .NET Framework and those portions of the Mono Project compliant 
with (a) and (b). 

"Enabling Technology" means underlying or enabling technology that may be 
used, combined, or distributed in connection with Microsoft's .NET Framework 
or other .NET Runtimes, such as hardware, operating systems, and applications 
that run on .NET Framework or other .NET Runtimes. 

.NET Core uses third-party libraries or other resources that may be
distributed under licenses different than the .NET Core software.

In the event that we accidentally failed to list a required notice, please

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS 
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR 
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS 
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE 
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED 
TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION 
OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

    "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other 
    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement 
    of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or 
    performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which 
    the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably 
    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will 
    not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance 
    of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the 
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") 
    will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
    "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias 
    and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject 
    matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the 
    selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in 
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more 
    other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, 
    which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a 
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes 
    of this License.
    "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the 
    Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
    "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the 
    Work under the terms of this License.
    "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, 
    individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity 
    can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance 
    the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, 
    declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or 
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the 
    person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; 
    and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
    "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License 
    including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic 
    domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, 
    such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work 
    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or 
    entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a 
    cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous 
    to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or 
    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process 
    analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or 
    three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a 
    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is 
    protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer 
    to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
    "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not 
    previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has 
    received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License 
    despite a previous violation.
    "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate 
    to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or 
    wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works 
    in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a 
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or 
    process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including 
    by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means 
    including signs, sounds or images.
    "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation 
    by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of 
    the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or 
    other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict 
any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided 
for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants 
You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable 
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

    to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to 
    Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
    to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any 
    translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise 
    identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could 
    be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification 
    could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

    For the avoidance of doubt:
        Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to 
        collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, 
        the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by 
        You of the rights granted under this License;
        Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect 
        royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the 
        Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You 
        of the rights granted under this License; and,
        Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether 
        individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that 
        administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of 
        the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. 
The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise 
the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by 
Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by 
the following restrictions:

    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must 
    include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of 
    the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work 
    that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise 
    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the 
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of 
    warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute 
    or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the 
    Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted 
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as 
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself 
    to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any 
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required 
    by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, 
    to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as 
    requested.
    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, 
    unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for 
    the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the 
    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or 
    Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, 
    journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service 
    or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if 
    supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies 
    to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or 
    licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an 
    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation 
    of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). 
    The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, 
    however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, 
    if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part 
    of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing 
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for 
    the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this 
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship 
    or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of 
    You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the 
    Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by 
    applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or 
    as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other 
    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's 
    honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any 
    exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) 
    would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action 
    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not 
    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national 
    law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right 
    to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND 
MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY 
OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE 
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL 
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE 
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach 
    by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations 
    or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated 
    provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. 
    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the 
    duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor 
    reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing 
    the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw 
    this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the 
    terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless 
    terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers 
    to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted 
    to You under this License.
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient 
    a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You 
    under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall 
    not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and 
    without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to 
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless 
    such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such 
    waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work 
    licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to 
    the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that 
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual 
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted 
    utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic 
    Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright 
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright 
    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the 
    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the 
    corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable 
    national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes 
    additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be 
    included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights 
    under applicable law.

limited by the following restrictions:

    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of 
    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier 
    (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or 
    Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that 
    restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the 
    Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of

    with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You 
    Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective 
    technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient 
    of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under 
    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as 
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart 
    from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If 
    You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the 
    extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by 
    Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from 
    any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation 
    any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms 
    of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same 
    License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction 
    license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same 
    License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); 
    (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation 
    under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms 
    of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of 
    the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), 
    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the 
    following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the 
    Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or 
    Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the 
    Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the 
    ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted 
    to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You 
    must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to 
    the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in 
    the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute 
    or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective 
    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a 
    recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that 
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) 
    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does 
    not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made 
    subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or 
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 
    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, 
    reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the 
    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the 
    Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., 
    a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution 
    Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other 
    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the 
    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, 
    that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does 
    not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; 
    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a 
    credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French 
    translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on 
    original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 
    4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that 
    in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will 
    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or 
    Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least 
    as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the 
    avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section 
    for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising 
    Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert 
    or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, 
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of 
    the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the 
    Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise 
    permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform 
    the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You 
    must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in 
    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's 
    honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), 
    in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License 
    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, 
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the 
    Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not 
    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by 
    the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right 
    under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS 
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING 
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, 
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE 
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS 
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT 
APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE 
LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, 
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities 
    who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, 
    however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals 
    or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 
    5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is 
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). 
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work 
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; 
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this 
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted 
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full 
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the 
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms 
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers 
    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and 
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable 
    law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder 
    of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to 
    this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach 
    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed 
    by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements 
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor 
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any 
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the 
    mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this 
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention 
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 
    28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, 
    the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal 
    Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject 
    matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License 
    terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions 
    of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national 
    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright 
    law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional 
    rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended 
    to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to 
cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, 
or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or 
(iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions 
granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but 
not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation 
of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated 
documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made 
available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or 
attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based 
on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, 
elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. 
For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and 
Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of 
the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, 
that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright 
owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the 
copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of 
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, 
including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code 
control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, 
the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding 
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by 
the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of 
whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within 
the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such 
Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, 
have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where 
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that 
are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim 
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative 
Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object 
form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this 
License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
changed the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, 
all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of 
the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative 
Works; and
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any 
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: 
within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party 
notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational 
purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum 
to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices 
cannot be construed as modifying the License. 

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional 
or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of 
Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions 
stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under 
the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any 
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, 
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable 
and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of 
the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law 
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited 
to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, 
or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has 
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance 
of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act 
only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other 
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor 
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor 
by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Microsoft Patent Promise for .NET Libraries and Runtime Components 

Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates ("Microsoft") promise not to assert 
any .NET Patents against you for making, using, selling, offering for sale, 
importing, or distributing Covered Code, as part of either a .NET Runtime or 
as part of any application designed to run on a .NET Runtime. 

If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in any claim in a lawsuit 
alleging direct or contributory patent infringement by any Covered Code, or 
inducement of patent infringement by any Covered Code, then your rights under 
this promise will automatically terminate. 

This promise is not an assurance that (i) any .NET Patents are valid or 
enforceable, or (ii) Covered Code does not infringe patents or other 
intellectual property rights of any third party. No rights except those 
expressly stated in this promise are granted, waived, or received by 
Microsoft, whether by implication, exhaustion, estoppel, or otherwise. 
This is a personal promise directly from Microsoft to you, and you agree as a 
condition of benefiting from it that no Microsoft rights are received from 
suppliers, distributors, or otherwise from any other person in connection with 
this promise. 

Definitions: 

"Covered Code" means those Microsoft .NET libraries and runtime components as 
made available by Microsoft at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime.

".NET Patents" are those patent claims, both currently owned by Microsoft and 
acquired in the future, that are necessarily infringed by Covered Code. .NET 
Patents do not include any patent claims that are infringed by any Enabling 
Technology, that are infringed only as a consequence of modification of 
Covered Code, or that are infringed only by the combination of Covered Code 
with third party code. 

".NET Runtime" means any compliant implementation in software of (a) all of 
the required parts of the mandatory provisions of Standard ECMA-335 – Common 
Language Infrastructure (CLI); and (b) if implemented, any additional 
functionality in Microsoft's .NET Framework, as described in Microsoft's API 
documentation on its MSDN website. For example, .NET Runtimes include 
Microsoft's .NET Framework and those portions of the Mono Project compliant 
with (a) and (b). 

"Enabling Technology" means underlying or enabling technology that may be 
used, combined, or distributed in connection with Microsoft's .NET Framework 
or other .NET Runtimes, such as hardware, operating systems, and applications 
that run on .NET Framework or other .NET Runtimes.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
