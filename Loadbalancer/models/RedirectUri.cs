    /// <summary>
    /// An object that defines the redirect URI applied to the original request. The object property values compose the
    /// redirect URI.
    /// <br/>
    /// **NOTE:** The Load Balancing service cannot automatically detect or avoid infinite redirects. Be sure to provide
    /// meaningful, complete, and correct field values. If any component field of this object has no value, the system
    /// retains the value from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    /// <br/>
    /// For example, if you specify only the protocol field `https`, and the incoming request URI is
    /// `http://example.com:8080`, the resulting runtime redirect URI is `https://example.com:8080`. The system retains
    /// the host and port from the incoming URI and does not automatically change the port setting from `8080` to `443`.
    /// <br/>
    /// Be sure to configure valid percent-encoding (URL encoding) when needed.
    /// <br/>
    /// In addition to static string values, you can use the following tokens to construct the redirect URI. These tokens
    /// extract values from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    /// <br/>
    /// *  {protocol} : The protocol from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    /// *  {host}     : The domain name from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    /// *  {port}     : The port from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    /// *  {path}     : The path from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    /// *  {query}    : The query string from the incoming HTTP request URI.
    /// <br/>
    /// The tokens are case sensitive. For example, `{host}` is a valid token, but `{HOST}` is not.
    /// <br/>
    /// You can retain the literal characters of a token when you specify values for the path and query properties of the
    /// redirect URI. Use a backslash (\\\\) as the escape character for the \\\\, {, and } characters. For example, if the
    /// incoming HTTP request URI is `/video`, the path property value:
    /// <br/>
    /// `/example{path}123\\{path\\}`
